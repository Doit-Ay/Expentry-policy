        </header>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Expentry! This Privacy Policy explains how Doitay ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information in relation to our mobile application "Expentry" (the "Service"). Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.</p>
            <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>Expentry is designed to help you track your expenses. The information we collect is primarily stored locally on your device.</p>
            <h3>Information You Provide Directly:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Receipt Details:</strong> When you add a receipt, you may provide information such as store name, purchase amount, date, category, notes, and an image of the receipt.</li>
                <li><strong>Images:</strong> If you use the image capture or gallery selection feature, we will require access to your device's camera or photo library to upload receipt images. These images are stored locally on your device as part of the receipt data managed by the app.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Information We Currently Do Not Collect:</h3>
            <p><em>(This list outlines data types generally not collected by the app as designed so far. If your app's functionality changes, this section must be updated.)</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We currently **do not** require you to create a user account.</li>
                <li>We currently **do not** collect personal identification information like your name (unless you voluntarily enter it in a receipt note), email address, or phone number for the core expense tracking functionality.</li>
                <li>We currently **do not** collect precise geolocation data.</li>
                <li>We currently **do not** use third-party analytics services that collect identifiable usage data tracking individual users.</li>
                <li>We currently **do not** collect financial account numbers or payment card details. The "amount" field is for tracking expenses you enter manually.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>The information you provide is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> To enable you to record, categorize, view, analyze, and manage your expense receipts directly on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All expense data, including any images you attach to receipts, is stored locally on your device using your device's application storage mechanisms (e.g., AsyncStorage or internal storage). This data is not automatically transmitted to us or any third-party servers unless you explicitly initiate a backup or export feature (note: such features are not part of the current application design but may be added in the future, at which point this policy would be updated).</li>
                <li><strong>For App Functionality:</strong> To perform calculations for analytics (like total spending, category breakdowns) that are displayed to you within the app, on your device.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
            <p>Since all your expense data is stored locally on your device by default:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We **do not share your personal expense data or receipt images with any third parties** in a way that identifies you, unless you explicitly choose to use a feature that involves sharing (e.g., an export feature, or if you in the future opt-in to a cloud backup service, which would be covered by an updated policy and require your consent).</li>
            </ul>
             <p><em>(Developer Note: If you add any third-party SDKs for ads, analytics, crash reporting, etc., you MUST disclose them here and explain what data they access and why, and link to their privacy policies.)</em></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your expense data (including text and images) is stored directly on your mobile device's local storage managed by the application.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> We rely on the security mechanisms of your mobile operating system to protect the data stored locally by the app. While we design the app with data protection in mind, please remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device (e.g., using passcodes, keeping your OS updated).</li>
                <li><strong>No Cloud Storage by Default:</strong> Expentry does not automatically back up or sync your data to any cloud servers owned or managed by Doitay. Any future cloud features would be opt-in and clearly explained.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Since data is stored locally on your device, it will remain there until:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You manually delete it from within the Expentry app.</li>
                <li>You uninstall the Expentry app (which typically removes the app's local data, subject to your device's operating system behavior).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p>As your data is stored locally, you have direct control over it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access and Correction:</strong> You can access and modify your expense data directly within the Expentry app.</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual receipts or all data from within the app. Uninstalling the app will also typically remove its data from your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can manage app permissions (like Camera or Photo Library access) through your device's system settings at any time. Disabling permissions may limit or break certain app functionalities that depend on those permissions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Expentry app is intended for a general audience and is **not directed at children under the age of 13** (or the relevant age of digital consent in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with information, please contact us using the details below so we can address the issue.</p>
            <p><em>(Developer Note: Be very certain about your target audience. If your app could attract children, you have stricter obligations under laws like COPPA, GDPR-K, and India's DPDP Act concerning children's data. Consult a legal expert if there's any doubt.)</em></p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Currently, Expentry does not integrate with third-party services that would collect your personal data for their own use.</p>
            <p><em>(Developer Note: This is a critical section. If you add ANY third-party SDKs – for analytics like Firebase Analytics or Google Analytics, crash reporting like Sentry or Crashlytics, advertising networks, cloud storage like Firebase Storage, etc. – you MUST list each service here, explain briefly what data it collects and why your app uses it, and provide a link to that service's own privacy policy.)</em></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app and/or on our app store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page or made available within the app.</p>
            <p>Your continued use of the Service after any modifications to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
